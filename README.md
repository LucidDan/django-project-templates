Django project and app templates for various styles and purposes

I build a lot of django apps for prototyping as well as clients and side projects.
These templates are an attempt to give myself a simple method to set up one of those projects, without going to the effort of building a full cookiecutter template.

Using any of these is just a matter of using the Django manage.py/djangoadmin command 'startproject' or 'startapp' with the ['--template' argument](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/django-admin/#cmdoption-startapp-template)
